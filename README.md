# Cavein-Escape-Room
  Final Project for NSC IT102 An Intro JavaScript Course [Demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/theGaryLarson/Cavein-Escape-Room/blob/main/index.html)
  <br></br>
 This is a web-based virtual "escape-room" style game. It includes interactive items leveraging JavaScript. I wrote the index.html, theme.css and all the .js files  except for highlight.js which I plan to use for an upcoming feature.
   <br></br>
   [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) offers syntax highlighting for the web.
   
   ### The premise for Cave-in
The idea behind this game is to create a framework to use simple stories to teach the basics of JavaScript. The idea is to use a pop-up menu where readers can craft their own items using basic JavaScript snippets. Throughout the rooms in the story there would be various "hidden" objects that they would discover. These objects would either be boolean variables or other user-defined objects. The code they create would allow them to interact with these variables to proceed through the story. Along their journey they would have to implement some basic code in their snippets to craft items to emerge successful.
